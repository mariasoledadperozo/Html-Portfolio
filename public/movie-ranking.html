<h1> Best Movies Of All Time by Sole</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>01. Little Women (2019) by Greta Gerwing</h3>
<p>I watched for the 2019 oscars, and It became my favourite movie <br> 
because Greta Gerwing turned to be my favourite director</p>
<h3>02. 13 Going on 30 (2005) by Gary Winick</h3>
<p>A classic for romcoms. I know every line of it, even the thriller <br>
choreo. It can be sad, cute and funny, but it has a wounderful message<br> 
that every kid, adult or teenager should hear</p>
<h3>03. Brokeback Mountain (2005) by Ang Lee</h3>
<p>This one should've won the Oscars. Everyone makes jokes about<br>
this movie, but this not the best gay movie, this is the best drama<br> 
romance movie of all time. Never cried so hard before.<Br>
PD: I miss you, Heath Ledger</p>
